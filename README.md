# 🩸 Real-Time Blood Alert System

## 📌 Overview
The **Real-Time Blood Alert System** is a multi-platform, AI-enhanced solution designed to connect hospitals facing urgent blood shortages with nearby, willing donors in real-time.  
It streamlines the process from **emergency request creation** to **successful donor mobilization** using **AI-driven donor ranking**, **smart notifications**, and **geo-targeted matching**.

---

## 🌟 Key Highlights
- **Hospitals & Admins** – Create verified alerts, monitor donations, manage blood stock, and collaborate with other hospitals.
- **Donors** – Receive location-based alerts, track donation history, and earn rewards via gamification.
- **Family/Public** – Submit emergency blood requests via a simple form (with verification to prevent spam).
- **AI/ML Features** – Donor prioritization, shortage forecasting, spam/fraud detection.
- **Real-Time Notifications** – SMS, Email, and Push Alerts for instant donor engagement.
- **Live Map View** – Real-time donor & hospital mapping for efficient coordination.
